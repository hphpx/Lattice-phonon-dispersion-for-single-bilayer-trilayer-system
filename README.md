# Lattice-phonon-dispersion-for-single-bilayer-trilayer-system
You need download Eigen C++ library in order to run this program.
This program is designed for lattice phonon dispersion calculation. The lattice type should be rhombic, the particle interaction is Yukawa. The output has two files, one contains the dispersion data, the other one contains the eigenvectors for each mode.
